In the **TLS Cipher Suites for Router** field, review the TLS cipher suites for TLS handshakes between Gorouter and front-end clients such as load balancers or HAProxy. The default value for this field is `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.
If you want to modify the default configuration,
use an ordered, colon-delimited list of Golang-supported TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format.
<br> Operators should verify that the ciphers are supported by any clients or front-end components that will initiate TLS handshakes with Gorouter. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by Gorouter, see [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers).

    Verify that every client participating in TLS handshakes with Gorouter has at least one cipher suite in common with Gorouter.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Specify cipher suites that are supported by the versions configured in the <strong>Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router</strong> field.</p>
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: The default cipher suites are required for communication with CAPI and removing them causes downtime. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn#cipher-downtime">Removal of Default Ciphers Causes Downtime when Upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3 and from 2.3 to 2.4</a>.</p>
