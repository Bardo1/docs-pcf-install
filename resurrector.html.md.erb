title: Using BOSH Resurrector on vSphere
owner: Ops Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The BOSH Resurrector increases Pivotal Application Service (PAS) availability in the following ways:

- Reacts to hardware failure and network disruptions by restarting virtual
machines on active, stable hosts
- Detects operating system failures by continuously monitoring virtual
machines and restarting them as required
- Continuously monitors the BOSH Agent running on each virtual machine and
restarts the VMs as required

The BOSH Resurrector continuously monitors the status of all virtual
machines in an PAS deployment.
The Resurrector also monitors the BOSH Agent on each VM.
If either the VM or the BOSH Agent fail, the Resurrector restarts the virtual
machine on another active host.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations ##

The following limitations apply to using the BOSH Resurrector:

* The Resurrector does not monitor or protect the Ops Manager VM or the BOSH
Director VM.
* The Resurrector might not be able to resolve issues caused by the loss of an
entire host.
* The Resurrector does not monitor or protect data storage.

For increased reliability, in addition to using BOSH Resurrector, Pivotal recommends that you use vSphere High Availability to protect all of the VMs in your deployment, and that you use a
highly-available storage solution.
