<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for enabling external blobstore backups in your
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.

BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) supports the following:

- Versioned S3 or S3-Compatible Blobstores
- Unversioned S3 or S3-Compatible Blobstores
- Azure Blobstores

For more information, see [Backup and Restore with External Blobstores](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>
  To enable external blobstore backups for PAS, the <strong>Backup Prepare Node</strong> must be enabled.
  See <a href=backup-pcf-bbr.html#backup-prepare-node>Enable Backup Prepare Node</a>
  in <em>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</em>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>
  The instructions below require the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) v2+.
  For more information, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#install">Install</a>
  in the BOSH documentation.</p>

## <a id="blobstore-support"></a> External Blobstore Support

External blobstore backup support varies based on which version of Ops Manager you are running and what type of blobstore you are backing up.

In some cases, external blobstore support is included in the version of Ops Manager you are using. In other cases, installing an Add-On is required. 

Refer to the table below to confirm the requirements of backing up your intended blobstore.

## <a id="s3"></a> S3 or S3-compatible Blobstores

In PAS v2.2, BBR supports backing up and restoring versioned and unversioned S3
or S3-compatible blobstores by default.
For more information about configuring an S3 or S3-compatible blobstore,
see [External S3 or Ceph Filestore](../pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#external_s3).

## <a id="azure"></a> Azure Blobstores

For information about configuring an Azure blobstore for backups and installing
the Azure Backups Add-On, see the following sections:

* [Configure an Azure Blobstore for Backups](#configuring-azure-blobstore)
* [Install the Azure Backups Add-On](#installing-azure-addon)

### <a id="configuring-azure-blobstore"></a> Configure an Azure Blobstore for Backups

To configure your Azure blobstore for backups, enable soft deletes in your Azure Storage account.
For more information, see
[Soft delete for Azure Storage blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete#quickstart)
in the Microsoft documentation.

To save storage space and cost, Pivotal recommends that you configure a retention
policy to permanently delete objects after a period of time.

### <a id="installing-azure-addon"></a> Install the Azure Backups Add-On

To enable BBR to back up and restore a PAS installation that uses an Azure blobstore,
you must install the Azure Backups Add-On.

To install the Azure Backups Add-On, follow the instructions below:

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the PAS tile.

1. From the URL in the address bar, record the deployment name of your PAS installation.
The name begins with `cf`.

    For example, in `https://pcf.example.com/products/cf-3247176589a379f246d1`,
    the deployment name is `cf-3247176589a379f246d1`.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the BOSH Director tile.

1. In the BOSH Director tile, select the **Credentials** tab.

1. Locate **Director Credentials** and click the corresponding **Link to Credentials**.
Record the identity and password.

1. Select the **Status** tab. Record the IP address of your BOSH Director.

1. From the [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-bosh-backup-and-restore)
page in Pivotal Network, download the latest version of the add-on.

1. To copy the release archive to your Ops Manager instance, run the following command:

    ```
    scp -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:~
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY` is the path to your Ops Manager private key.
    * `SEMVER` is the semantic version of the add-on that you downloaded in the previous step.
    * `YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP` is the IP address of your Ops Manager VM.

1. SSH into the Ops Manager instance by following the instructions in
[SSH Into Ops Manager VM](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. In the Ops Manager VM, authenticate with your BOSH Director by following the
instructions in [Log in to the BOSH Director](../trouble-advanced.html#log-in).
Use the Director Credentials and Director IP address that you recorded in previous steps.

1. To upload the release that you downloaded from Pivotal Network, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate upload-release backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of your BOSH Director.
    * `SEMVER` is the semantic version of the add-on that you are uploading.

1. To confirm that the release upload has succeeded, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate releases
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of your BOSH Director.

    You should see a `backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER` entry.

1. To download your current runtime configuration and save it as a file named
`runtime-config.yml`, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate runtime-config > runtime-config.yml
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of your BOSH Director.

    If you receive an error message that references a missing runtime configuration,
    create an empty file and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.

1. Append the following to the `releases` section of your `runtime-config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    releases:
    # Append the below to the list of releases:
    - name: backup-and-restore-sdk-addon
      version: RELEASE-VERSION
    ```
    Where `RELEASE-VERSION` is the release version.

1. Append the following to the `addons` section of your `runtime-config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    addons:
    # Append the below to the list of addons:
    - name: sdk-preview
      jobs:
      - name: azure-blobstore-backup-restorer
        release: backup-and-restore-sdk-addon
        properties:
          enabled: true
          containers:
            droplets:
              name: NAME-OF-DROPLETS-CONTAINER
              azure_storage_account: AZURE-STORAGE-ACCOUNT
              azure_storage_key: AZURE-STORAGE-KEY
            packages:
              name: NAME-OF-PACKAGES-CONTAINER
              azure_storage_account: AZURE-STORAGE-ACCOUNT
              azure_storage_key: AZURE-STORAGE-KEY
            buildpacks:
              name: NAME-OF-BUILDPACKS-CONTAINER
              azure_storage_account: AZURE-STORAGE-ACCOUNT
              azure_storage_key: AZURE-STORAGE-KEY
      include:
        deployments:
        - PAS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
        jobs:
        - name: mysql-backup
          release: cf-backup-and-restore
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * In the `droplets`, `packages`, and `buildpacks` section, replace the text
    with the values configured in Ops Manager.
    * In the `include` section, replace the text with the PAS deployment name
    that you recorded in a previous step.

1. (Optional) To configure backup and restore for Azure Sovereign Cloud, configure
the `environment` property described in the
[Backup and Restore SDK Documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/backup-and-restore-sdk-release/blob/develop/docs/blobstore-backup-restore.md#Azure-Blobstores)
topic in GitHub.

    For more information about Azure Sovereign Cloud,
    see [Microsoft National Clouds](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/cloudservices/nationalcloud)
    in the Microsoft documentation.

1. To complete updating the runtime configuration, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate update-runtime-config runtime-config.yml
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of your BOSH Director.

1. Navigate to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.
