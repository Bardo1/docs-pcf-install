title: Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR
owner: RelEng
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<% $this_topic = 'backup-pcf' %>

This topic describes the procedure for backing up your critical backend Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To restore your backup, see the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

To view the BBR release notes, see the [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html).

During the backup, BBR stops the Cloud Controller API and the Cloud Controller workers to create a consistent backup. Only the API functionality, like pushing applications or using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) are affected. The deployed applications do not experience downtime.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can only use BBR to back up PCF v1.11 and later. To back up earlier versions of PCF, perform the <a href="backup-pcf.html">manual procedures</a>.</p>

<div class="note warning">
  <strong>WARNING</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backup artifacts can contain secrets.</strong> Secure backup artifacts by using encryption or other means. </li>
    <li><strong>The restore is a destructive operation.</strong> BBR is designed to restore PCF after a disaster. If it fails, the environment may be left in an unusable state and require reprovisioning. For more information, see <a href="restore-pcf-bbr.html">Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>The Cloud Controller API will stop sending and receiving calls</strong> for the duration of PCF restoration.</li>
    <li><strong>BBR does not back up any service data.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Using an external MySQL database results in an unusable restore</strong> even if the restore appears to run successfully.</li>
    <li><strong>BBR requires an add-on to back up and restore external blobstores</strong>. For more information, see <a href="enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html">Enabling External Blobstore Backups</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>For PCF v2.0.0, BBR only supports backup and restore of environments with zero or one CredHub instances. <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#2.0.17">PAS v2.0.17</a> resolves this issue.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>


## <a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

Pivotal recommends the following:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup. This ensures that you always have a consistent backup of Ops Manager and PAS to restore from.
* Back up frequently, especially before making any changes to your PCF deployment, such as the configuration of any tiles in Ops Manager.


## <a id="restore-compatibility"></a> Compatibility of Restore

When using a backup to restore, you must ensure that the restore environment is compatible. For more information, see [Compatibility of Restore](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#compatibility).


## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

BBR is a binary that can back up and restore BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors.
BBR requires that the backup targets supply scripts that implement the backup and restore functions.

BBR backs up the following components:

* **PAS**: In PCF v2.0, BBR can back up and restore PAS configured with the following:
  * An internal MySQL database
  * An internal WebDAV/NFS blobstore or an external AWS or Azure blobstore
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To back up and restore the supported external blobstores
  with BBR, you must install Blobstore Addon. For more information, see <a href="./enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html">Enabling External Blobstore Backups</a>.
  </p>
  In PCF v2.0, BBR cannot back up and restore PAS configured with an external MySQL database or with
  unsupported external blobstores. For guidance about backing up unsupported databases and blobstores, see
  [Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS](#guidelines).

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Backup artifacts of external, S3-compatible, versioned blobstores do not contain the physical blobs. BBR requires that the original buckets still exist to be restored.</li>
    <li>To protect yourself from losing a bucket, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-s3-versioned-replication">Enable Replication on Your External Blobstore</a> in <em>Backup and Restore with External Blobstores</em> in the Cloud Foundry documentation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

* **BOSH Director**: The BOSH Director must have an internal Postgres database and an internal blobstore
to be backed up and restored with BBR. As part of backing up the BOSH Director, BBR backs up the BOSH UAA
database and the CredHub database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BBR support for backing up and restoring external databases and
  blobstores varies across PCF versions. For more information, see
  <a href="#version-compatibility">External Storage Support Across PCF Versions</a>.
</p>

## <a id="version-compatibility"></a> External Storage Support Across PCF Versions

The following table shows what types of external databases and blobstores you can back up and restore
with BBR in PCF v1.11 through v2.3.

<%= image_tag("images/bbr-supported-components.png") %>

## <a id="guidelines"></a> Unsupported External Blobstores and Databases in PAS

If you configured an unsupported external blobstore or an unsupported external database in PAS, see
the following guidelines to perform backup successfully:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured a supported database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process, and copy the external blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured an unsupported external database and a supported blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process and copy the external database by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You configured both an unsupported external database and an unsupported external blobstore in PAS.</td>
    <td>Follow the PCF backup process but do not back up PAS. Copy the external database and blobstore by using the IaaS-specific tool.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> You may encounter inconsistencies between the blobstore and database. If apps do not appear during a restore, repush those apps.</p>

## <a id='backup-services'></a> Backing Up Services

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> BBR does <strong>not</strong> currently back up any service data.</p>

Keep in mind the following when backing up services:

* BBR backs up and restores the service bindings, but not the service data.
* You can redeploy on-demand service instances manually during restore, but the data in the instance is not backed up.
* BBR does not back up managed services or their data.
* You can back up and restore brokered services with the procedures documented in this topic and in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic. 

## <a id='workflow'></a> Workflow

Operators download the BBR binary and transfer it to a jumpbox. Then they run BBR from the jumpbox, specifying the name of the BOSH deployment to back up.

BBR examines the jobs in the BOSH deployment, and triggers the scripts in the following stages:

1. **Pre-backup lock**: The pre-backup lock scripts locks the job so backups are consistent across the cluster.
1. **Backup**: The backup script backs up the release.
1. **Post-backup unlock**: The post-backup unlock script unlocks the job after the backup is complete.

Scripts in the same stage are all triggered together. For instance, BBR triggers all pre-backup lock scripts before any backup scripts. Scripts within a stage may be triggered in any order.

The backup artifacts are drained to the jumpbox, where the operator can transfer them to storage and use them to restore PCF.

The following diagram shows a sample backup flow.

<%= image_tag('backup-flow.png') %>

Before using BBR, follow the instructions in the [Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html) section.


## <a id='prepare'></a> Prepare to Create Your Backup

### <a id='setup-jumpbox'></a> Step 1: Set Up Your Jumpbox

Prepare your jumpbox for BBR by following the steps in the [Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR](system-setup-bbr.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you regularly update the BBR binary on your jumpbox to the latest version</a>. See <a href="system-setup-bbr.html#scp">Transfer BBR Binary to Your Jumpbox</a> in <em>Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR</em> for more information.</p>

### <a id='encrypt-key'></a> Step 2: Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the Cloud Controller Database encryption credentials from the PAS tile:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager in a browser and log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Select PAS **Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.

1. Record the **Db Encryption Credentials**. You must provide these credentials when you contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io) for assistance restoring your installation.

	<%= image_tag("ccdb-encrypt-creds.png") %>

### <a id="retrieve"></a> Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director and the credentials for logging in from the Ops Manager Director tile:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director_bbr' %>

### <a id='check-director'></a> Step 4: Check your BOSH Director

Perform the following steps to back up your BOSH Director:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the Ops Manager tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Locate **Bbr Ssh Credentials** and click **Link to Credential** next to it.
<br><br>
You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr_ssh_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic.

1. Copy the value for `private_key_pem`.

1. SSH into your jumpbox:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ ssh -i LOCAL-PATH-TO-JUMPBOX-PRIVATE-KEY JUMPBOX-USER@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
	</pre>

1. Run the following command to reformat the key and save it to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY` in the current directory, pasting in the contents of your private key for `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY`:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY
  </pre>

1. Run the BBR `pre-backup-check` command from your jumpbox:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ bbr director \
	  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
	  --username bbr \
	  --host HOST \
	  pre-backup-check
	</pre>
	Replace the placeholder values as follows:
	* `PRIVATE-KEY`: The path to the private key file you created above
	* `HOST`: The address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public,
  this is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is
  the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`, which you retrieved in the
  [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section of this topic.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code>
    flag to enable debug logs. See the <a href="#logging">Logging</a> section of
    this topic for more information.</p>

1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Step 5: Make Sure the Backup Prepare Node is Deployed](#backup-prepare-node)
below.
<br><br>
If the pre-backup check fails, the Director might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection
to the BOSH Director might have failed.

### <a id='backup-prepare-node'></a> Step 5: Make Sure the Backup Prepare Node is Deployed

When BBR backs up PAS, it needs a Backup Prepare node. This procedure makes sure that the Backup Prepare node is deployed.

1. In Ops Manager, open the **<%= vars.product_full %>** tile.

1. In the **Resource Config** pane find the **Backup Prepare Node** job and check if the **Instances** dropdown menu is set to `1`.
<%= image_tag("backup-prepare-node.png") %>

1. If the **Instances** dropdown menu is not set to `1`:
  1. Set the **Instances** dropdown menu to **1**.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Navigate back to the Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.

### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 6: Identify Your Deployment

After logging in to your BOSH Director, run the following command to identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

Name                     Release(s)
cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                         cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                         binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                         capi/1.28.0
                         cf-autoscaling/91
                         cf-mysql/35
                         ...
</pre>

In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF is `cf-example`.

### <a id='check'></a> Step 7: Check Your Deployment

Perform the following steps to check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. From your jumpbox, run the BBR pre-backup check:
	<pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
      bbr deployment \
      --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
      --username BOSH-CLIENT \
      --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
      --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
      pre-backup-check
	</pre>
    Replace the placeholder values as follows:
    <br><br>
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD`: From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Ops Manager Director**, navigate to the **Credentials** tab, and click **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials** to retrieve the BOSH UAA credentials.<br><br>
    You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_bbr_client_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic.<br><br>
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 6: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment) section.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE`: This is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. For more information, see [Ensure BOSH Director Certificate Availability](./system-setup-bbr.html#root-ca-cert).

1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, continue to [Create Your Backup](#procedure) below.
<br><br>
If the pre-backup check fails, the deployment you selected might not have the correct backup scripts,
or the connection to the BOSH Director might have failed.


## <a id='procedure'></a> Create Your Backup

### <a id='export'></a> Step 8: Export Installation Settings

Pivotal recommends that you back up your Ops Manager installation settings by exporting frequently.

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind the following:

- This option is only available after you have deployed at least once.

- Always export your installation settings before following the steps in the
[Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import)
section of the _Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR_ topic.

- Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in Ops Manager.
It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

- Your Ops Manager settings are encrypted. Make sure you keep track of your
Decryption Passphrase because this is needed to restore the Ops Manager settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  When exporting installation settings for Ops Manager v1.12 and later, releases
  are not included in the output file.
  Releases are now included in the BOSH director backup, therefore, the output file is
  much smaller than in previous Ops Manager versions.
</p>

There are two ways to export Ops Manager installation settings:

- [Use the Ops Manager UI](#export-using-ui)
- [Use the Ops Manager API](#export-using-api)

#### <a id='export-using-ui'></a>Option 1: Use the Ops Manager UI

To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager UI, do the following:

1. From the **Installation Dashboard** in the Ops Manager interface, click your
user name at the top right navigation.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click the **Export Installation Settings** button.
    <%= image_tag("settings.png") %>

#### <a id='export-using-api'></a> Option 2: Use the Ops Manager API

If you want to automate the back up process, you can use the Ops Manager API to
export your installation settings.

To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager API, run the following command:

```
curl OPSMAN-URL/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
```

For instructions about authenticating and retrieving the `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN`, see
[Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html).

### <a id='bbr-backup-director'></a> Step 9: Back Up Your BOSH Director

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The BOSH Director backup can take more than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR backup command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails.<br>Use <code>nohup</code>, a <code>screen</code>, or a <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up your BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bbr director \
  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
  --username bbr \
  --host HOST \
  backup
</pre>

Replace the placeholder values as follows:

* `PRIVATE-KEY`: The path to the private key file you created in [Step 4: Check your BOSH Director](#check-director)
* `HOST`: The address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, this is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`, which you retrieved in [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve).
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Use the optional <code>--debug</code> flag to enable debug logs. See the <a href="#logging">Logging</a> section of this topic for more information.</p>

If your backup terminates early or fails, clean up by running backup-cleanup:

If your backup terminates early or fails, you can clean up by running backup-cleanup:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bbr director \
  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
  --username bbr \
  --host HOST \
  backup-cleanup
</pre>

### <a id='bbr-backup'></a> Step 10: Back Up Your PAS Deployment

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Backing up PAS can take more than 5 minutes, and can take considerably longer with larger blobstores or slow network connections. The backup also incurs Cloud Controller downtime during which users are unable to push, scale, or delete apps. Your apps will not be affected.</li>
    <li>Because the BBR backup command can take a long time to complete, Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

1. (Optional) If you are not using an internal blobstore or a versioned S3-compatible external blobstore, create a copy of the blobstore with your IaaS specific tool. Your blobstore backup may be slightly inconsistent with your PAS backup depending on the duration of time between performing the backups.

1. Run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up your PAS deployment:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup
  </pre>
  * Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information, see [Logging](#logging) below.
  * Use the optional `--with-manifest` flag to ensure that BBR downloads your current deployment manifest when backing up. These manifests are included in the Ops Manager export, but are useful for reference. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">
      $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
        bbr deployment \
        --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --username BOSH-CLIENT \
        --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
        backup --with-manifest</pre>

If the command fails, do the following:

1. Run backup-cleanup:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-PASSWORD \
     bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup-cleanup</pre>

1. Ensure all the parameters in the command are set.

1. Ensure the BOSH Director credentials are valid.

1. Ensure the specified deployment exists.

## <a id='after'></a> After Taking Your Backup

### <a id='transfer-artifacts'></a> Step 11: Transfer Backup Artifacts

After creating your backup successfully, perform the following steps:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your preferred storage space. The backup created by BBR consists of a folder with the backup artifacts and metadata files. Pivotal recommends compressing and encrypting the files.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup artifacts and store them in multiple locations to minimize the risk of losing backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Attempt to restore each backup.

1. To validate your artifacts, proceed to [Step 12: Validate Your Backup](#validate-backup).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Backup artifacts may contain data covered by the <a href="#gdpr">European Union's <em>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></a>.</p>

### <a id='validate-backup'></a> Step 12: (Optional) Validate Your Backup

If you want to validate your backup, follow the instructions below:

<div class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director should not be visible to the new BOSH Director</strong> when validating your backup. As a result, Pivotal recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed-up BOSH Director.</li>
    <li><strong>Data services outside of PCF may produce unexpected side effects during restoration.</strong> The services will try to connect to those data services when you restore to a new environment. For example, consider an app that processes mail queues and connects to an external database. When you validate your backup in a test environment, the app may start processing the queue, and this work may be lost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

After backing up PCF, you may want to validate your backup by restoring it to a similar environment and checking the applications. Because BBR is designed for disaster recovery, its backups are intended to be restored to an environment deployed with the same configuration.

To spin up a second environment that matches the original in order to test a restore, do the following:

1. Export your Ops Manager installation by performing the steps in the [Step 8: Export Installation Settings](#export) section.

1. Create a new Ops Manager VM in a different network to the original. Ensure that the Ops Manager VM has enough persistent disk to accommodate the files exported in the previous step. Consult the topic specific to your IaaS:<br><br>
  * [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to AWS](../aws-terraform.html)
  * [Configuring AWS for PCF](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html)
  * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](../azure-arm-template.html)
  * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](../gcp-om-deploy.html)
  * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](../openstack-setup.html)
  * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../deploying-vm.html)

After you deploy the second environment, follow the instructions in the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

#### <a id='ert-validate'></a> Validate Your PAS Backup Only

For a sandbox or other non-production environment, you can optionally perform an _in-place_ restore of PAS only. In this case, you restore the PAS backup to the same PCF environment that the backup was created from. Follow the procedures in [Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR](restore-pcf-bbr.html#restore-ert).

## <a id='logging'></a> Logging

BBR outputs logs to stdout. By default, BBR logs:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as pre-backup scripts or backup scripts
* When the process is complete
* When any error occurs

If more logging is needed, use the optional `--debug` flag to print the following information:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server
* All commands executed on remote instances
* All commands executed on local environment
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed

## <a id='canceling-backup'></a> Cancelling a Backup

If you need to cancel a backup, perform the following steps:

1. Enter `CTRL-C` to terminate the BBR process, then enter `yes` to confirm.

1. Run the BBR `backup-cleanup` command from your jumpbox.

  * For a cancelled director backup, run the following:

      ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    backup-cleanup
      ```
  * For a cancelled deployment backup, run the following:

      ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    backup-cleanup
      ```

## <a id="gdpr"></a> European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Backup artifacts may contain data covered by the European Union's _General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_. Please be mindful that any backup artifacts may contain personal data. For example, a backup of PAS could contain user email addresses. As such, backup artifacts should be handled in accordance with organizational policies and applicable laws as they pertain to security, confidentiality, and privacy.
