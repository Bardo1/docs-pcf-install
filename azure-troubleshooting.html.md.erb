This topic describes how to troubleshoot known issues when deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure.


## <a id="install-issues"></a> Troubleshoot Installation Issues

### <a id="timeouts"></a> Slow Performance or Timeouts

#### Symptom

Developers suffer from slow performance or timeouts when pushing or managing apps, and end users suffer from slow performance or timeouts when accessing apps

#### Explanation

The Azure Load Balancer (ALB) disconnects active TCP connections lying idle for over four minutes.

#### Solution

To mitigate slow performance or timeouts, the default value of the **Router Timeout to Backends (in seconds)** field is set to 900 seconds. This default value is set high to mitigate performance issues but operators should tune this parameter to fit their infrastructure.

To edit the **Router Timeout to Backends (in seconds)** field:

1. Select the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile that is located within your **Installation Dashboard**. 
1. Select the **Networking** tab.
1. Enter your desired time, in seconds, within the **Router Timeout to Backends (in seconds)** field.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="cannot-copy-om"></a> Cannot Copy the Ops Manager Image

#### Symptom

Cannot copy the Ops Manager image into your storage account when completing [Step 2: Copy Ops Manager Image](./azure-arm-template.html#copy) of the _Launching an BOSH Director Instance with an ARM Template_ topic
or [Step 4: Boot Ops Manager](../om/azure/deploy-manual.html#boot) of the _Launching an BOSH Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template_ topic.

#### Explanation

You have an outdated version of the Azure CLI. You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.0 or greater. Run `az --version` from the command line to display your current Azure CLI version.

#### Solution

Install the Azure CLI 2.0 by following the instructions for your operating system in the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### <a id="create-env-fails"></a> Deployment Fails at "create-env"

#### Symptom

After clicking **Apply Changes** to install Ops Manager and PAS, the deployment fails at `create-env` with an error message similar to the following:

```
Command 'deploy' failed:
  Deploying:
    Creating instance 'bosh/0':
      Waiting until instance is ready:
        Starting SSH tunnel:
          Parsing private key file '/tmp/bosh_ec2_private_key.pem':

			/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh.yml"; 
			Duration: 328s; Exit Status: 1
Exited with 1. 
```

#### Explanation

You provided a passphrase when creating your key pair in the [Step 2: Copy Ops Manager Image](./azure-arm-template.html#copy) section of the _Launching a BOSH Director Instance with an ARM Template_ topic or [Step 4: Boot Ops Manager](../om/azure/deploy-manual.html#boot) section of the _Launching a BOSH Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template_ topic.

#### Solution

Create a new key pair with no passphrase and redo the installation, beginning with the step for creating a VM against the Ops Manager image in the [Step 2: Copy Ops Manager Image](./azure-arm-template.html#copy) section of the _Launching a BOSH Director Instance with an ARM Template_ topic or the [Step 4: Boot Ops Manager](../om/azure/deploy-manual.html#boot) section of the _Launching a BOSH Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template_ topic.

### <a id="database-permissions"></a> Insufficient External Database Permissions

Upgrade issues can be caused when the external database user used for the network policy DB is given insufficient permissions. To avoid this upgrade issue, ensure that the networkpolicyserver database user has the `ALL PRIVILEGES` permission.
