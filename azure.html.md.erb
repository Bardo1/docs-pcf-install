This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Azure.

To view production-level deployment options for PCF on Azure, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Azure](../refarch/azure/azure_ref_arch.html).

## <a id="azure"></a> Azure Requirements

The following are the minimum resource requirements for deploying a PCF deployment with Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on Azure:

* VMs:
  - **PAS**: At a minimum, a new Azure deployment requires the following VMs for PAS:
<table border='1' class='nice'>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan=6>PAS and Ops Manager</th>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F1s</td>
    <td>27</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F2s</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F4s</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS11 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS12 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
By default, PAS deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).
  - **Small Footprint PAS**: To run Small Footprint PAS, an Azure deployment requires:
<table id='azure-requirements' border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
  </tr></tr>
    <th>Azure Requirements</th>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th rowspan=4>Small Footprint PAS</th>
    <td>DS11 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS12 v2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F2s</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Add 1 to count if using HAProxy</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F1s</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
  	<th rowspan=2>Ops Manager</th>
    <td>DS2 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F4s</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Specific instance types are only supported in certain regions. See the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/">Azure documentation</a> for a complete list. If you are deploying PCF in a region that does not support the above instance types, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsman-api#overriding-defaults-with-custom-disk-types">Ops Manager API documentation</a> for instructions on how to override the default VM sizes. Changing the default VM sizes may increase the cost of your deployment. </p>

* An OS disk of 120&nbsp;GB for the Ops Manager VM.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

* To deploy PCF on Azure, you must have the Azure CLI v2.0. For instructions on how to install the Azure CLI for your operating system, see [Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on Azure Manually](../om/azure/prepare-env-manual.html#install).


## <a id="permissions"></a> Azure Permissions Guidelines

Pivotal recommends following the principle of least privilege by scoping privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role. See [IaaS Permissions Guidelines](./iaas-user-roles.html) for recommendations on how to create and scope Azure accounts for PCF.


## <a id="security"></a> Azure Security Documents

* [Azure security documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/)<br />
This site has documentation on Azure security tools. It provides a general guide to how to manage IaaS users and credentials.
