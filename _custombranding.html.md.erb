See the [Inviting New Users](../console/console-roles.html#invite) section of the <em>Managing User Roles with Apps Manager</em> topic for more information.

1. Select **Display Marketplace Service Plan Prices** to display the prices for your services plans in the Marketplace.

1. Use **Product Name**, **Marketplace Name**, and **Customize Sidebar Links** to configure page names and sidebar links in the **Apps Manager** and **Marketplace** pages.

1. The **Apps Manager Polling Interval** field provides a temporary fix if Apps Manager usage causes degradation of the Cloud Controller API. Pivotal recommends that you do not keep this field modified as a long term fix because it can degrade Apps Manager performance. You can optionally do the following:	
	* Increase the polling interval above the default of `30` seconds. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a value between <code>0</code> and <code>30</code>, the field is automatically set to <code>30</code>.</p>
	* Disable polling by entering `0`.
