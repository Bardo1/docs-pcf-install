                <td>1</td>
                <td>The optimal balance between CPU/memory sizing and instance count depends on the performance characteristics of the apps that run on Diego cells. Scaling vertically with larger Diego cells makes for larger points of failure, and more apps go down when a cell fails. On the other hand, scaling horizontally decreases the speed at which the system re-balances apps. Re-balancing 100 cells takes longer and demands more processing overhead than re-balancing 20 cells.</td>
