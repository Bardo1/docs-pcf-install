This topic describes how floating stemcells work in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and the consequences for upgrading product tiles in Ops Manager.

For Ops Manager v2.1 and later, stemcells do not float by default. When you import a stemcell with the Stemcell Library dashboard, you are prompted to select the products that float their stemcell. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

Floating stemcells allow upgrade to the minor versions of stemcells but not the major versions. 

For example, a stemcell can float from `1234.56` to `1234.99` but not from `1234.991` to `1235.0`.

When an operator upgrades a product tile, Ops Manager checks to see whether a new minor, or patch, version of the stemcell exists. 
If a minor stemcell is available from the current major line, Ops Manager installs the upgraded tile and all compatible product tiles in the deployment on the new stemcell. 
This ensures that PCF can quickly propagate a patched stemcell to all virtual machines in the deployment when a vulnerability is discovered.

Operators can now perform certain deployment-wide updates, such as CVEs, by uploading a new stemcell instead of uploading `.pivotal` files for each tile, which reduces the time spent waiting for files to upload. Operators can upload new stemcells using the Ops Manager API or by using the Ops Manager Stemcell Library dashboard.

However, operators who want to upgrade a single product tile may face significantly longer wait times, depending on the number of tiles in the deployment and the availability of a new stemcell.
