       You can either provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or click on the **Generate RSA Certificate** link to generate a self-signed certificate in Ops Manager.</li>
    <li> If you want to configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter, click the **Add** button and fill in the appropriate fields for each additional certificate keypair.<br/><br/>
