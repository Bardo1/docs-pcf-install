Pivotal defines an Availability Zone (AZ) as an operator-assigned, functionally independent segment of network infrastructure. In cases of partial infrastructure failure, a tile distributes and balances all instances of running apps across remaining AZs. Strategic use of Availability Zones contributes to the fault tolerance and high availability of a tile deployment.

vSphere supports distributing deployments across multiple AZs. For more information, see _Step 4: Create Availability Zones_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../om/vsphere/config.html#create-az). 

It is recommended that customers use three Availability Zones to operate a highly available tile deployment.


## <a id="example-case"></a> Balancing Across AZs During Failure: Example Scenario

An operator scales an app to four instances in a tile environment distributed across three availability zones:
A1, A2, and A3. The environment allocates the instances according to the [Diego Auction](../concepts/diego/diego-auction.html).

  <%= image_tag("az_er_1.png") %>

If A1 experiences a power outage or hardware failure, the two app instances running in A1 terminate while the app instances in zones A2 and A3 continue to run:

  <%= image_tag("az_er_2.png") %>

If A1 remains unavailable, the tile balances new instances of the app across the remaining availability zones:

  <%= image_tag("az_er_3.png") %>
