<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are
available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use PCF JMX Bridge to consume
these component metrics outside of the Firehose, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this,
leave the <strong>JMX Provider IP Address</strong> field blank. For additional guidance, see
<a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics">BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose</a>
in the PCF v2.0 Release Notes.</p>

This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Recreate All Persistent Disks** to force BOSH to migrate and recreate persistent
disks for the BOSH Director and all tiles. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** to instruct Ops Manager to retry failed
BOSH operations up to five times.



1. <%= partial 'legacy-deploys' %>



1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve BOSH Director VMs
after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

1. (Optional) Modify the **Director Workers** value,
  which sets the number of workers available to execute
  Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.



1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of
  threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. Pivotal
  recommends that you leave the field blank to use the defaul
  value, unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.



1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director,
  enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can
  also use this field to configure [a load balancer in front
  of your BOSH Director](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Set-Up-a-Load-Balancer-in-Front-of-Ops-Manager-Director).  
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you change the <strong>Director
  Hostname</strong> after your initial deployment, you can
  cause downtime. Changing the hostname triggers all VMs to be recreated. </p>
