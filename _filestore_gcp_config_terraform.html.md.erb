PAS can use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as its external filestore by using either a GCP interoperable storage access key or your GCS Service Account. See below for how to configure each option.

#### External Google Cloud Storage with Access Key and Secret Key

1. Select the **External Google Cloud Storage with Access Key and Secret Key** option
<%= image_tag("gcp/gcp-filestore-gcs-access-key.png") %>
1. Enter values for **Access Key** and **Secret Key**. To obtain the values for these fields:
   1. In the GCP Console, navigate to the **Storage** tab, then click **Settings**.
   1. Click **Interoperability**.
   1. If necessary, click **Enable interoperability access**. If interoperability access is already enabled, confirm that the default project matches the project where you are installing PCF.
   1. Click **Create a new key**.
         <%= image_tag("gcp/gcp-key-secret-create.png") %>
   1. Copy and paste the generated values into the corresponding PAS fields. PCF uses these values for authentication when connecting to Google Cloud Storage.
   1. Enter the names of the storage buckets you created in [Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP](../om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#dbs):
      * **Buildpacks Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `buildpacks_bucket` from your Terraform output. 
      * **Droplets Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `droplets_bucket` from your Terraform output.
      * **Resources Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `packages_bucket` from your Terraform output.
      * **Packages Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `resources_bucket` from your Terraform output.
   1. Click **Save**.

#### External Google Cloud Storage with Service Account

1. Select the **External Google Cloud Storage with Service Account** option
<%= image_tag("gcp/gcp-filestore-gcs-service-account.png") %>
   1. For **GCP Project ID** enter the Project ID on your GCP Console that you want to use for your PAS file storage.
   1. For **GCP Service Account Email** enter the email address associated with your GCP account.
   1. For **GCP Service Account JSON** enter the account key that you use to access the specified GCP project, in JSON format.
   1. Enter the names of the storage buckets you created in [Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP](../om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#dbs):
      * **Buildpacks Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `buildpacks_bucket` from your Terraform output. 
      * **Droplets Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `droplets_bucket` from your Terraform output.
      * **Resources Bucket Name**: Enter the value of `packages_bucket` from your Terraform output.
