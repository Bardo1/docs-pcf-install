This topic describes key features of the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Operations Manager interface.

<%= image_tag("interface.png") %>

- **A**--- Displays a list of products you have imported that are ready for installation.
	* Click the **Import a Product** link to add a new product to Ops Manager.
	* If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. If you are using the [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html), the latest version of an existing product appears automatically.
 	* Click **Delete All Unused Products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **C**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**.

- **D**---**Settings**: This menu option opens a page with several configuration panes. See the [Settings Page](#settings) section of this topic for details.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued products and updates that will install during the next deploy. Clicking on a product expands its list of errands and lets you change the errand run rules for the next deploy. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes button**: Clicking the button applies pending changes, as listed, to your deployment. You can also view the logs of past installation updates by clicking **Change Log**.

- **G**---**Orange colored bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is required before deployment. Click on the product tile to complete its configuration. In addition, the **Apply Changes** button is low lit to indicate that changes cannot be applied without additional product configuration.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When an update depends on prerequisites, the prerequisites automatically install first.</p>
