The following list describes each labeled section of the Installation Dashboard:

- **A**--- Displays a list of products you have imported that are ready for installation.
	* Click the **Import a Product** link to add a new product to Ops Manager.
	* If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. If you are using the [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html), the latest version of an existing product appears automatically.
 	* Click **Delete All Unused Products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **C**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**.

- **D**---**Settings**: This menu option opens a page with several configuration panes. See the [Settings Page](#settings) section of this topic for details.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued products and updates that will install during the next deploy. Click on a product to expand its list of errands and change the errand run rules for the next deploy. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes button**: Click the button to apply pending changes, as listed, to your deployment. Click **Change Log** to view the logs of past installation updates.

- **G**---**Orange bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is required before deployment. Click on the product tile to complete its configuration. In addition, the **Apply Changes** button is low lit to indicate that changes cannot be applied without additional product configuration.

- **H**---**Stemcell Library**: Click the link to open the Stemcell Library. In the Stemcell Library you can import stemcells, stage stemcells, and review your stemcell version numbers. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **I**---**Change Log**: Click the link to view and search a log of your previous installations. See the [Change Log Page](#changelog) section of this topic for details.

- **J**---**Review Pending Changes BETA**: Click the button to go to the "Review Pending Changes" page, which organizes pending changes by tile. You are able to enable or disable each tile to selectively deploy individual tiles. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](review-pending-changes.html).

- **K**---**API Docs**: Click the link to go to the Ops Manager API documentation, which details how you can manage Ops Manager through the API rather than with the user interface. For more information about the Ops Manager API, see [Using the Ops Manager API](ops-man-api.html).
