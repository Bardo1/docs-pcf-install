The following list describes each labeled section of the Installation Dashboard:

- **A**--- Displays a list of products you have imported that are ready for installation.
	* Click the **Import a Product** link to add a new product to Ops Manager.
	* If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. If you are using the [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html), the latest version of an existing product appears automatically.
 	* Click **Delete All Unused Products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **C**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**.

- **D**---**Settings**: This menu option opens a page with several configuration panes. See the [Settings Page](#settings) section of this topic for details.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued products and updates that will install during the next deploy. Click on a product to expand its list of errands and change the errand run rules for the next deploy. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes button**: Click the button to apply pending changes, as listed, to your deployment. Click **Change Log** to view the logs of past installation updates.

- **G**---**Orange bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is required before deployment. Click on the product tile to complete its configuration.

- **Export Installation Settings**: Exports the current installation with all of its assets. When you export an installation, the exported file contains references to the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings.

- **Syslog**: Viewable by administrators only. Configure a custom Syslog server for Ops Manager. When you select **Yes** and fill the following fields, Ops Manager produces and sends all Ops Manager logs to the configured syslog endpoint.
  * **Address** - Enter the address or host of the syslog server.
  * **Port** - Enter the port on which the syslog server listens.
  * **Transport Protocol** - Select either `TCP`, `UDP`, or `RELP` to specify a transport protocol used to send syslog messages to your server.

Your **Permitted Peer** is either the accepted fingerprint such as a SHA1 or the name of the remote peer. For example, `*.example.com`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager does not issue a warning if your credentials are invalid. Instead, Ops Manager continues as if your credentials are correct. Test your syslog server to ensure that it is receiving Ops Manager logs.</p>
