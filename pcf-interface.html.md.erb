	* If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. If you are using the [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html), the latest version of an existing product appears automatically.
 	* Click **Delete All Unused Products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued products and updates that will install during the next deploy. Clicking on a product expands its list of errands and lets you change the errand run rules for the next deploy. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes button**: Clicking the button applies pending changes, as listed, to your deployment. You can also view the logs of past installation updates by clicking **Change Log**.
