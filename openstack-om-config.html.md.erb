This topic describes how to configure BOSH Director after deploying [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack. Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

* Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed 
all steps in [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html).

* After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Deploying PAS on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see <a href="./ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a>.</p>


## <a id='log-in'></a> Step 1: Access Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](./openstack-setup.html#dns-entry) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you choose **Use an Identity Provider**, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you choose **Internal Authentication**, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Use Internal Authentication

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>


## <a id='openstack-config'></a> Step 2: OpenStack Config Page

1. In the left navigation of your OpenStack dashboard, click **Project > Compute > Access & Security**. Select the **API Access** tab.

1. Record the **Service Endpoint** for the **Identity** service.
You use this Service Endpoint as the Authentication URL for Ops Manager in a
later step.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/record-endpoint.png") %>

1. In the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/director-tile-openstack.png") %>

1. Select **OpenStack Config**.

1. Complete the **OpenStack Management Console Config** page with the following information:
    * **Authentication URL**: Enter the Service Endpoint for the Identity
      service that you recorded in a previous step.
    * **Keystone Version**: Choose a Keystone version. If you choose **v3**, 
      you must enter a **Domain** to authenticate against. 
    * **Username**: Enter your OpenStack Horizon username.
    * **Password**: Enter your OpenStack Horizon password.
    * **Tenant**: Enter your OpenStack tenant name.
    * **Region**: Enter `RegionOne`, or another region if recommended by your
      OpenStack administrator.
    * **Select OpenStack omNetwork Type**: Select either **Nova**, the legacy 
      OpenStack networking model, or **Neutron**, the newer networking model.
    * **Ignore Server Availability Zone**: Do not select the checkbox.
    * **Security Group Name**: Enter `opsmanager`. You created this Security
      Group in the [Configure Security](./openstack-setup.html#security) step 
      of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.
    * **Key Pair Name**: Enter the name of the key pair that you created in the 
      [Configure Security](./openstack-setup.html#security) step of 
      _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.
    * **SSH Private Key**: In a text editor, open the key pair file that you
      downloaded in the [Configure Security](./openstack-setup.html#security)
      step of _Provisioning the OpenStack
      Infrastructure_. Copy and paste the contents of the key pair file into 
      the field.
    * (Optional) **API SSL Certificate**: If you configured API SSL termination 
      in your OpenStack Dashboard, enter your **API SSL Certificate**.
    * **Disable DHCP**: Do not select the checkbox unless your configuration 
      requires it.
    * **Select OpenStack Network Type**: Select either **Nova**, the legacy
      networking model, or **Neutron**, the OpenStack networking model.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/view-network-info.png") %>

1. In Ops Manager, select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-create-networks-config.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable. 
Review the [Configure Security](../customizing/openstack-setup.html#security) step of _Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to OpenStack_ to ensure you have configured ICMP in your Security Group.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks using information from your OpenStack network:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * For **Network ID**, use the **ID** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **CIDR**, use the **Network Address** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, use the first 10 IP addresses of the **Network Address** range, and the private IP address of the Ops Manager instance that you recorded in the [Associate a Floating IP Address](./openstack-setup.html#floating-ip) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.
    * For **DNS**, enter one or more Domain Name Servers.
    * For **Gateway**, use the **Gateway IP** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Availability Zones**, select which Availability Zones to use with the network.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-resource-config.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>
