    * To use the internal UAA, select the **Internal** option and follow the instructions in the [Configuring UAA Password Policy](../opsguide/pw-policy.html) topic to configure your password policy.
    * To connect to an external identity provider through SAML, scroll down to select the **SAML Identity Provider** option and follow the instructions in the [Configuring PCF for SAML](../opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-saml) section of the _Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_ topic.
    * To connect to an external LDAP server, scroll down to select the **LDAP Server** option and follow the instructions in the [Configuring LDAP](../opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-ldap) section of the _Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for PAS_ topic.
